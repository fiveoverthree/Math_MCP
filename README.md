# Math MCP Server

Math MCP Server is a Python 3.12 Model Context Protocol server that exposes a broad mathematics toolkit over stdio. It combines symbolic algebra, calculus, numerical methods, linear algebra, statistics, discrete mathematics, graph theory, rendering, and optional GPU acceleration behind MCP tools that are usable from Claude Desktop, GitHub Copilot, and other MCP-compatible hosts.

The server is designed to run on CPU-only systems by default. If CUDA and CuPy are available, the GPU tool family accelerates supported workloads automatically and otherwise falls back to CPU implementations when possible.

## Installation

Editable install with `uv`:

```bash
uv pip install -e .
```

For GPU acceleration (requires CUDA 12.x and a compatible NVIDIA GPU):

```bash
uv pip install -e ".[gpu]"
```

Editable install with `uv` and optional GPU support:

```bash
uv pip install -e ".[gpu]"
```

Editable install with `pip`:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

Use the base install for CPU-only systems. Install the `gpu` extra only on machines with a compatible CUDA 12.x environment.

For development dependencies and tests:

```bash
.venv/bin/uv sync --extra dev
```

## Running The Server

Run directly with Python:

```bash
python -m math_mcp.server
```

Run through `uv`:

```bash
uv run python -m math_mcp.server
```

Run via the console script:

```bash
math-mcp-server
```

The server communicates over stdio, which is the expected transport for most MCP hosts.

## MCP Host Configuration

Most MCP clients accept a JSON config that declares a named server, the command to run, and its arguments. A generic config looks like this:

```json
{
	"mcpServers": {
		"math": {
			"command": "/absolute/path/to/.venv/bin/python",
			"args": ["-m", "math_mcp.server"],
			"cwd": "/absolute/path/to/math-mcp-server"
		}
	}
}
```

If the package is already installed in the active environment, you can use the console script instead:

```json
{
	"mcpServers": {
		"math": {
			"command": "math-mcp-server"
		}
	}
}
```

### Claude Desktop

Add the `math` server entry to your Claude Desktop MCP configuration file and point it at either the environment Python executable or the installed `math-mcp-server` script.

### GitHub Copilot

Use the same `mcpServers` structure in your MCP-enabled Copilot or VS Code host configuration. The server name can remain `math` so it matches the packaged MCP entry point.

### Other MCP Hosts

Any host that supports stdio MCP servers can run this project with the same command and args shown above.

## Hardware Requirements

- Python 3.12 or newer.
- CPU-only systems are fully supported for the non-GPU tool families.
- Optional CUDA-capable NVIDIA GPU for the GPU tool family.
- If CUDA or CuPy is unavailable, GPU tools either fall back to CPU implementations or report that GPU acceleration is not available.
- Memory needs depend on workload size. Large symbolic expressions, large matrices, and graph algorithms can require significant RAM.

## Example Queries

- Simplify `(x^2 - 1) / (x - 1)`.
- Solve `x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0` over the reals.
- Compute the definite integral of `sin(x)` from `0` to `pi`.
- Find the eigenvalues of `[[4, 1], [1, 3]]`.
- Fit an exponential decay model to observed time-series data.
- Compute the bootstrap confidence interval for a sample mean.
- Factor `123456789` into prime powers.
- Find the shortest weighted path from node `A` to node `D`.
- Render the equation `x^2 + y^2 = 1` as an implicit plot.
- Multiply a batch of matrices with GPU acceleration if hardware is available.
